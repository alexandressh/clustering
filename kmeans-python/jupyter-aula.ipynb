This was mabey made in korea and its realy popular there so they were  stuck watching this over and over again. 2. Over 2billion people have access to the Internet, including youtube, and  the numbers are rising, by 2017 half of the populatoin will be connected. 3. Hackers In Korea may have loved it so much they rised it to 2billion  hits to make it more popular.  4. The song was featured in a just dance game, on multiple mp3s, and been  seen on concerts and even on new years eve event in 2012, so just by seeing  those you mabey adding more hits to this video. 5.

Over 2billion people have access to the Internet, including youtube, and  the numbers are rising, by 2017 half of the populatoin will be connected. 3. Hackers In Korea may have loved it so much they rised it to 2billion  hits to make it more popular.  4. The song was featured in a just dance game, on multiple mp3s, and been  seen on concerts and even on new years eve event in 2012, so just by seeing  those you mabey adding more hits to this video. 5.

      "im sorry for the spam but My name is Jenny. I go to high school where  everyone dresses fashionable but for me I don't because i need money to buy  cute clothes. I have low self esteem . I live with my dad. my mom passed  away when i was 6 so i don't really have a mother figure. I have 2 brothers  who is older than me. Since they are boys they get the attention while i  just be alone. I really want to wear pretty clothes like the girls in my  school and get a boyfriend. i just can't be my self. im very quite and shy  at school because i don't have the confidence in myself to talk to someone.  i did have one friend name Caroline but she moved away so now im alone. if  you could donate some money to me it would be great. i don't care about  expensive brand ill just shop at walmart because they have pretty clothes.  also i wanna get my nails done at a salon . i see alot of girls have these  french tips. i never had my nail did at a salon before i will really  appreciate if i can and get my hair curled too. http://www.gofundme.com/dressprettyonce thanks omg please.√Ø¬ª¬ø\n",

This was mabey made in korea and its realy popular there so they were  stuck watching this over and over again. 2. Over 2billion people have access to the Internet, including youtube, and  the numbers are rising, by 2017 half of the populatoin will be connected. 3. Hackers In Korea may have loved it so much they rised it to 2billion  hits to make it more popular.  4. The song was featured in a just dance game, on multiple mp3s, and been  seen on concerts and even on new years eve event in 2012, so just by seeing  those you mabey adding more hits to this video. 5. You are complaining to much on how the heck this has 2b hits.√Ø¬ª¬ø\n",

Ever since Katy Perry's divorce  it's wave after wave of shitty but successful songs... For those of you  saying \"This is the next wave of pop music\". Stick it up your ass. Katy  Perry is like Silly Putty. √Ø¬ª¬ø\n",

      "I've figured out why I dislike this song: it's supposed to be a power  ballad right? Something that's uplifting and motivating by the end.  However, the final chorus has NO extra UMPH at the end and actually sounds  just like the first one. Instead of crescendo-ing into a powerful finish,  \"Roar\" just says on the same wavelength. It falls flat.√Ø¬ª¬ø\n",

This was mabey made in korea and its realy popular there so they were  stuck watching this over and over again. 2. Over 2billion people have access to the Internet, including youtube, and  the numbers are rising, by 2017 half of the populatoin will be connected. 3. Hackers In Korea may have loved it so much they rised it to 2billion  hits to make it more popular.  4. The song was featured in a just dance game, on multiple mp3s, and been  seen on concerts and even on new years eve event in 2012, so just by seeing  those you mabey adding more hits to this video. 5. You are complaining to much on how the heck this has 2b hits.√Ø¬ª¬ø\n",

It√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s this weird technique where you wager on something with one bookmakers and bet against it on Betfair. You secure the bonus as income . A chap named Jim Vanstone is finding the wagers free on his own website Vanstone Secrets (Google it!). I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve made about 500 quid thus far. And it is cost-free. I guess the bookies pay him to obtain new consumers, yet this actually works.\n",

I really want to wear pretty clothes like the girls in my  school and get a boyfriend. i just can't be my self. im very quite and shy  at school because i don't have the confidence in myself to talk to someone.  i did have one friend name Caroline but she moved away so now im alone. if  you could donate some money to me it would be great. i don't care about  expensive brand ill just shop at walmart because they have pretty clothes.  also i wanna get my nails done at a salon . i see alot of girls have these  french tips. i never had my nail did at a salon before i will really  appreciate if i can and get my hair curled too. http://www.gofundme.com/dressprettyonce thanks omg please.√Ø¬ª¬ø\n",

This was mabey made in korea and its realy popular there so they were  stuck watching this over and over again. 2. Over 2billion people have access to the Internet, including youtube, and  the numbers are rising, by 2017 half of the populatoin will be connected. 3. Hackers In Korea may have loved it so much they rised it to 2billion  hits to make it more popular.  4. The song was featured in a just dance game, on multiple mp3s, and been  seen on concerts and even on new years eve event in 2012, so just by seeing  those you mabey adding more hits to this video. 5. You are complaining to much on how the heck this has 2b hits.√Ø¬ª¬ø\n",
